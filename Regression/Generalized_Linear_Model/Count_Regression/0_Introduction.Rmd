# Count Regression

Ordinary least squares estimation in the classical regression framework is not viable for a count variable as a dependent variable. The reasons are:  
- Counts cannot be negative but a linear model implies possible negative estimates
- Counts can only take on integer values. This makes the error term in the general linear model inconsistent
- Count data often exhibit heteroscedasticity (larger variance with larger mean, meaning more error at higher count values)


Difference between true zeros and excess zeros:
- true zeros: had the chance for a count, so 0 is an actual value
- excess zeros: had not the chance for a count, so 0 


# Overview over Count Regression Models

- Poisson Regression
    + one parameter model
- Negative Binomial Regression
    + two parameter model (mean of distribution and overdispersion parameter $\alpha$)
    + if $\alpha$ = 0 --> negative binomial distribution = poisson distribution
- Zero-Inflated Count Models
    + Zero-Inflated Poisson
    - Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial
- Zero-truncated Count Models
    + in these models 0 does not happen (or very unlikely?!)
- Hurdle Models
  + one model for modeling zeros (binomi) and one model for modeling counts > 0 
  + poisson-logit hurdle regression
