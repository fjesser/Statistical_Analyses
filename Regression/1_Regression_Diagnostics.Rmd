# Introduction


# Multicollinearity

Problem
- high multicollinearity means ... (not only high bivariate correlations between predictors)

Detection
- Variance inflation factor

Solution
1) Drop variables
2) Combine highly correlated variables
3) PCA or factor analysis
4) factor regression

# Linearity

Problem
- 

Detection
- Plot y vs. each X (link to visualization)
- Fit polynomials 

Solution
- Fit polynomials
- transform x and/or y
- nonlinear regression
- GLM (link to glm)

# Outliers

Problem
- 

Detection
- 

Solution
- Remove data if error
- Robust regression
- mixture models (cluster of outliers)
- sometimes transformation helps

# Homoskedasticity

Problem
- often true when X is a count

Detection
- 

Solution
- transform Y
- weighted regression
- count regression (glm)
