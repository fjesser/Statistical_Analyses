# Introduction

- primarily mathematical description of matrix approach to (multiple) regression
- based on linear algebra (link to linear algebra)
- good to know to understand regression in another way and also to understand other, more complicated procedures that build up on this 

# Unstandardized Multiple Regression in Matrix Form
