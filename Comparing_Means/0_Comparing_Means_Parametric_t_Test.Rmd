# Introduction


Comparing two means.

Effect sizes:
- cohen's $d$ is positively biased, hedges' $g$ is a bias corrected version for small sample sizes.




# Packages

```{r packages}
library(effectsize) # for effect size
library(skimr) # descriptive statistics
library(tidyverse) # data wrangling, plotting, etc.
```


# Comparing an observed mean to an expected mean - one sample $t$-test

# Comparing two independent groups - independent two sample $t$-tests
# Comparing two dependent groups - dependent two sample $t$-test

## Assumptions of the dependent $t$-test

## Conducting the dependent $t$-test

## Reporting the dependent $t$-test

## Visualizing Results
