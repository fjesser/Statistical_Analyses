# Introduction and Overview

# Two Nominal Variables

## Two Dichotomous Variables

### The $\varphi$ coefficient - Product-Moment-Correlation of dichotomous variables

value range: [-1, +1]
boundary value can only be obtained if relationship is perfect **and** both variables have the same distribution.

The more both distributions differ, the smaller the possible absolute value of $\varphi$.

There are corrections but it is easier to use other correlation measures for dichotomous variables.

### Yules Q

### Odds-Ratio

### Tetrachoric Correlation

Application of the polychoric correlation on dichotomous variables.


## Two Polytomous Variables

### Contingency Coefficient

Based on $\chi^2$ value. 
inferior to Cramer's $V$ becauseit can never reach it's upper boundary!

### Cramer's $V$

Based on the $\chi^2$ value
is identical to $\varphi$ in the case of dichotomous variables. 
value range: [0, 1]
