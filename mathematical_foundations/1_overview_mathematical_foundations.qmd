# Introduction

"Mathematics is first and foremost the study of how to use numbers." [@Kropko2016, p. 2]


To perform statistical analyses, one must apply and use mathematics. Therefore, a solid knowledge of mathematical foundations is important in order to understand statistical methods. In this section, *Mathematical Foundations*, all necessary foundations are summarized. The structure of this section is divided according to the [Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dewey_Decimal_classes#Class_500_%E2%80%93_Science) [@OCLC2011] for mathematics. The DDC is a library classification system in which mathematics is assigned the class 510. Within this class, the subdisciplines of mathematics are specified^[The reader should not be left unaware of the fact that there are different ways to classify the subdisciplines/branches/areas of mathematics. For an additional view see @Gowers2008.]. For the purposes of this section, only the necessary subdisciplines are included. They are:

1. Arithmetic
2. Algebra
3. Analysis
4. Probability
